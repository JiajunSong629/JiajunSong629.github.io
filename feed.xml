To address this question, we examine the mortality rate for each procedure type in a hospital. Specifically, we fit a Bayesian joint model of mortality rates and hospital volumes to estimate the mortality rates by hospital and procedure. After ranking the hospital performances for the given procedures, we find that Texas Children’s Hospital, UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital and Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital are the best hospitals for pediatric cardiovascular procedures. In addition to having good predictive output, our ranking system allows for us to quantify the uncertainty surrounding parameter and ranking estimates, allowing us to rigorously conclude that our findings are significant.</p> <p>Read the full essay <a href="/assets/pdf/mortality.pdf">here</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="applied-stats"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on historic mortality rate, we design a decision rule for which hospital to go to given the specific condition.

However, the differences in the stopping rate could also be explained by spatial heterogeneity among different precincts or by the presence of disproportionate crime rates for different racial groups. In this study we try to assess the presence of racial disparities and to consider their evolution in time. Our study shows that even with these controls there is strong evidence for a significant bias against the African-Americans, and, to a less extent, against the Hispanics. However, we find some evidence that these discriminatory phenomena have been reducing over the course of the last years.</p> <p>Read the full essay <a href="/assets/pdf/policing.pdf">here</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="applied-stats"/><category term="causal-inference"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our study shows that even with these controls there is strong evidence for a significant bias against the African-Americans.
